# battleship-game
 Simple [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game played in the console.
 Its intended for 2 players alternating turns after each shot.
 The game ends once one player manages to sink all ships of his opponent.
 
 Note that this is a [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/) project so the rules may differ from the original game.
 Most notably:
 - No extra turns
 - You are being told when you sink a ship
 - If you shoot at the same cell twice by mistake its treated as a miss
   and you are not prompted to give new input
